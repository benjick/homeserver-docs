# Authelia

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) and 2-factor authentication (2FA) functionalities. It is designed to integrate with various identity providers, including SAML and LDAP. Authelia also includes advanced features such as role-based access control (RBAC) and user session management. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Unraid installation

I'm using IBRACORP's Authelia Unraid app for this guide. This app uses the official Docker image provided by Authelia. You can find the app in the Unraid Community Applications repository.

## Configuration

On first run Authelia will create a default config. In this guide I will go through what we need to change in order to get a minimal setup going.

Because the configuration file is written in YAML, you will need to use a YAML editor to edit the configuration file. I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) installed.

### Basic configuration

1. Under `access_control: default_policy:` we want to set the default policy to `one_factor`. This will allow users to login with just a username and password. If you want to require 2FA for all users, you can set this to `two_factor`, but you will need to configure a 2FA provider first.
2. Under `authentication_backend:` we want to uncomment everything under `file:` and set `path:` to `/config/users_database.yml`. This will tell Authelia to use the users database file we will create later.
3. Under `jwt_secret:` we want to set the secret to a random string. This will be used to sign the JWT tokens Authelia generates. You can generate a random string using the following command:

```bash {{title: 'Generate random string'}}
openssl rand -hex 32
```

4. Under `session:` we want to change `domain:` to our own domain name.
5. We also want to uncomment `storage:` and under that `encryption_key:` and `local:` (with its children) as well. Don't forget to generate another secure password for the encryption key.

### Access rules

Above we set the `access_control` to `default_policy: one_factor`. This means that all traffic will be protected behind a username and password. However, we might want to add some special cases.

Under access control we can add the following:

```yaml
rules:
  # If we set the policy to "bypass" for a domain it will not require any authentication
  - domain: public.mydomain.com
    policy: bypass

  # If you are running for example the app Wizarr (https://wizarr.dev)
  # we need to add some expection to allow invited people access to links
  # without authenticating them via Authelia
  #
  # We need to specify the bypass policy first
  - domain: wizard.mydomain.com
    policy: bypass
    resources:
      # https://docs.wizarr.dev/using-wizarr/single-sign-on-sso
      - ^/join$
      - ^/j/.*$
      - ^/setup.*$
      - ^/static/.*$
  # Finally we specify the one_factory policy for resources not covered above
  - domain: wizard.mydomain.com
    policy: one_factor
```

### User configuration

We need to create a file called `users_database.yml` in the config folder. This file will contain all the users that can login to Authelia. The file should look something like this:

```yaml {{title: 'users_database.yml'}}
# yamllint disable rule:line-length
---
###############################################################
#                         Users Database                      #
###############################################################

users:
  your_username:
    disabled: false
    displayname: 'Your Name'
    password: 'HASH_GOES_HERE'
    email: email@example.com
    groups:
      - admins
      - dev
---
# yamllint enable rule:line-length
```

Replace `your_username` with your own username. You can also add more users if you want. You can generate a password hash using the following command in the Unraid console:

```bash {{title: 'Generate password hash'}}
docker run --rm authelia/authelia authelia hash-password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

## Using Authelia

To use Authelia you need to configure your reverse proxy to use it. I'm using Nginx Proxy Manager, but it's compatible with other reverse proxies as well.

You can find information on how to use it with Nginx Proxy Manager [here](/nginx-proxy-manager#full-configuration-example).

Authelia also has [documentation](https://www.authelia.com/integration/proxies/) on how to configure it with other reverse proxies.
