# Protocol

Protocol is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

```bash
yarn
cp .env.example .env.local
yarn dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Global search

By default this template uses [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com) for the global search. DocSearch is free for open-source projects, and you can sign up for an account on their website. Once your DocSearch account is ready, update the following [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) in your project with the values provided by Algolia:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCSEARCH_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCSEARCH_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCSEARCH_INDEX_NAME=
```
